# Decryption-Of-Unique-Code

At Codebar, I wanted to work with Angular to do some fun things, and so I was given this challenge by someone there - create a page that would decrypt a code. The key is that for numbers 1-26, it corresponds to that place letter in the alphabet (1 = a, 2 = b, etc). If it's over 26, it must be divided by 27 until it is under 27, while numbers that come out as a decimal count as a space. Very simple, took about an hour.
